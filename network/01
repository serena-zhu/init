# A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network.
# A network interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form.

# en - Ethernet. en0 is the first interface. (Additional Ethernet interfaces would be named en1, en2, etc.) 
# This type of interface is usually a NIC connected to the network by a category 5 cable. en0 and en1 are your physical network connections (wired and wireless LAN). 
# On systems with both an ethernet and wireless connection, en0 will be your ethernet interface and en1 will be your wireless interface. 
# A MAC address will be shown for both en0 and en1 and likely labelled as "ether".

# lo - loop back, a special network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself
# awdl - air drop peer to peer 
# bridge - connection between networks
